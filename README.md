# Website Authentication flow for Amazon Selling Partner API and Advertising API

This is a PHP based website authentication flow for Amazon's Selling Partner API and Advertising API. Amazon's new SP-API allows stores to grant access to Amazon Partners through a web-based Login-with-Amazon (LWA) authorization. The Amazon Advertising API uses a similiar LwA authorization flow for Amazon Partners.
